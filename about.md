# About Me

Hi there! I'm Bartek Kiliszek, a backend developer with a passion for building robust and scalable systems.

- **Java Programming**: Exploring the depths of Java, from core concepts to advanced frameworks
- **System Design**: Learning about distributed systems, databases, and architecture patterns
- **Problem Solving**: Tackling complex problems with elegant solutions

## Why This Blog?

- Connect with fellow developers
- Create a reference for myself and others

## Interests

Beyond coding, I'm interested in:
- Software architecture and design patterns
- Performance optimization
- Open source contribution
- Continuous learning and improvement
